## Development Ethos
- *It's OK to break stuff on development. Take the ownership and send the fix.*
- *Help other people while reviewing the PR. and Be respectful if somebody needs to improve something on their code. The goal is to work together and have some fun.*
- *If you can, use a ton of emojis while reviewing the PR or replying to comments in the PR. ðŸ˜‰*
- *Don't shy away from sending a PR, we are more than happy to help you out in the process.*

## Code Strucutre
- *The philosophy of the code strucutre is keeping things as small as they can be. Keeping functions small, components small, and files small. Basically keeping everything as small as they can be. Like Minions, We love Minions. Who doesn't .*
